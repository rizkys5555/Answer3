1: Create the R Markdown File
In RStudio (or the Coursera Lab Sandbox), go to File > New File > R Markdown.... 
A. Add the Date
In the YAML header (the top section between ---), set the date to update automatically to the current date using an inline R expression: 
yaml

---
title: "My Leaflet Map"
author: "Your Name"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: html_document
---

Use code with caution.
B. Add the Leaflet Map
Insert an R code chunk (Ctrl + Alt + I) and use the following code to create a basic interactive map: 
r

library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lat=40.7488, lng=-73.9854, popup="Empire State Building")
my_map

Use code with caution.
2: Generate the HTML
Click the Knit button in RStudio. This will run the code and save a file named yourfilename.html on your computer (or in the sandbox). 
3: Host Your Webpage
The assignment requires you to host this file on one of three platforms: 

    RPubs: This is the easiest method. In the RStudio preview window, click the Publish button and select RPubs.
    GitHub Pages: Create a public repository, upload your HTML file (renamed to index.html), and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
    NeoCities: Create a free account and upload your HTML file directly to their web interface.
